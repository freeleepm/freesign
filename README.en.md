## Introduction

Free Sign – Your Electronic Contract Signing Expert, Safe, Efficient, and Easy Contract Management

Free Sign is an innovative online electronic contract signing product that offers you a safe and efficient signing experience. We understand that contract signing is not only about the rights and obligations of both parties but also a **transfer of trust**. Therefore, we have integrated a series of financial-grade security features such as **facial recognition and ID verification** to ensure that every signing is genuine and reliable.

Free Sign also has four core functions: **Credit Center, Quick IOU, Online Customer Service, and Promoter Ambassador**. Through the Credit Center, you can easily check the credit records of the other party to provide a reliable reference for signing contracts; the Quick IOU function allows you to quickly initiate contracts and save valuable time; Online Customer Service is always available to answer your questions and ensure a smooth usage experience; and the Promoter Ambassador is a sharing platform that allows you to enjoy convenient services while bringing more users to the platform and sharing benefits.
